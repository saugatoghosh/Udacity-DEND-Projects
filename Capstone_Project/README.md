### Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Capstone Project

For the capstone project I have used the following Udacity provided datasets: 

- **I94 Immigration Data:** This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. A data dictionary is included. The source of the dataset is [here](https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html)

- **US City Demographic Data** This data comes from OpenSoft and is accessible [here](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/)

The goal of this project is to use Apache Spark and the Udacity provided datasets to create a database. This database can be used to answer questions about where (countries) immigrants were coming from and where (cities in the U.S.) they were coming to over different periods of time.

The project follows the following steps:

1. Scope the project and gather data
2. Explore and assess the data
3. Define the data model
4. Run ETL to model the data
5. Complete project write-up

Please refer to the **Capstone Project.ipynb** file for details of the steps above. 

A shareable link to the **'tables'** folder containing the written parquet files is provided [here](https://r766466c839826xjupyterlnnfq3jud.udacity-student-workspaces.com/lab/tree/tables)
